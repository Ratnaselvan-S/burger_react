### 📌 About

This was my **first React project**, and it helped me understand the core concepts of:

- Props and State
- Class-based lifecycle methods
- Redux actions, reducers, and store
- Component reusability and structure

Although it's a simple app, I tried to implement as much real-world logic as possible and structure it like a scalable application.

- Add authentication (signup/login)
- Add order history
